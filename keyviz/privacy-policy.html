    <h2>Keyviz doesn't collect any "personal data"</h2>
    <p>No personal data is collected from the user. 
    Only configuration (settings) data is stored as raw json in user's local system. 
    The app engages in no ad targeting, data mining, or other activities that may compromise your privacy, and we do not affiliate ourselves with any third parties that do so.
    <br/>
    The app doesn't use any internet hence no data is stored outside user's local machine as well.
